# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline with JSON-driven Configuration
This project builds a fully automated machine learning pipeline that reads model configuration, feature processing, and training settings from a JSON file embedded in an RTF document. It supports various regression algorithms, handles missing data, performs feature reduction (PCA, tree-based, etc.), and applies hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The entire workflow is dynamically driven by the configuration, making it highly adaptable to different datasets and modeling strategies without changing the core code.
